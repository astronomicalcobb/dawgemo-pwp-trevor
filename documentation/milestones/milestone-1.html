                <strong>Name:</strong>
                Ryan Garcia
            </p>
            <p class="pb-2">
                <strong>Age:</strong>
                37
            </p>
            <p class="pb-2">
                <strong>Profession:</strong>
                Self Employed General Contractor
            </p>
            <p class="pb-2">
                <strong>Technology:</strong>
                Mac user that's a little behind the times. Ryan has an iPhone 14 (6.1-inch) and MacBook Pro (15-inch, 2016).
            </p>
            <p class="pb-2">
                <strong>Attitudes and Behaviors:</strong>
                Ryan is a busy man who's always on the go, as he has many projects he oversees. While working, Ryan only uses his iPhone to search for subcontractors; he will spend a short amount of time per business to see if they are a good candidate. At home, he uses his laptop and spends more time researching good subcontractors.
            </p>
            <p class="pb-2">
                <strong>Frustrations and Needs:</strong>
                When searching for subcontractors on the go, Ryan needs to find the about-info of a business quickly, so he can contact them right away. Ryan hates bad websites, and will not hesitate to look for another business that takes their webpage seriously. ESPECIALLY when that website doesn't have a dark-mode.
            </p>
            <p class="pb-2">
                <strong>Goals:</strong>
                Ryan's job is to get information about a subcontractor quickly, so he can get a quote from them, they can make a deal, and the subcontractor can get to work. His goal is to determine if a business is the right fit for the job and to hire them by looking at, via their website, some work they've done, what areas they work in, and their contact information.
            </p>

                <strong>User Story:</strong>
                I need a water well drilled for a site I am overseeing that is going to have a home built on it.
